# Microcouch Rust
This is a Rust based Microcouch. It is work in progress. The design has been scratched out in the [JavaScript Microcouch](https://github.com/jo/microcouch-js) and this Rust version will lean on this.

Currently there is only a HTTP adapter. Replication works between two http databases.

Next steps:

* implement sqlite based local database struct

and so much more to do :/
