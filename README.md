# Microcouch Rust
This is a Rust based Microcouch. It is work in progress. The design has been scratched out in the [JavaScript Microcouch](https://github.com/jo/microcouch-js) and this Rust version will lean on this.

Currently there is only a HTTP adapter. Replication works between two http databases.

Next steps:

* come up with a Database trait and implement the http database upon it
* implement a sqlite database class

and so much more to do :/
